  "bio1": "Hello, I am a software engineer based in London. At 17 years old, I moved from Greece to the UK for my studies. I first attended the University of Bradford for my Foundation Studies, and then I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London. Recently, I started working as an software engineer at Sky while simultaneously staying updated with the latest technological advancements.",
  "bio2": "I am passionate about continuous learning, building software, investing, sailing, scuba diving and music. I'm currently engaged in developing two applications using React, enhancing my understanding of algorithms, and preparing for the AWS certification exam.",
  "bio3": "In my leisure time, my activities vary by location; in the UK, I stay active with exercises, swimming, and cycling. Meanwhile, in Greece, you'll likely find me sailing, diving into the depths, or exploring the mountain trails.",
  "lorem": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
